## üèóÔ∏è Account Setup Examples

### Single Account Setup
All strategies use one account - good for smaller capital or testing:

```bash
# List current strategies
make config-list

# All strategies use account index 0 by default
# No additional setup needed for single account
```

### Multi-Account Setup
Each strategy uses dedicated account - ideal for larger operations:

```bash
# Set specific account IDs for each strategy
STRATEGY=barbell_convex ACC_ID=12345 make config-account
STRATEGY=balanced_income ACC_ID=12346 make config-account  
STRATEGY=volatility_bet ACC_ID=12347 make config-account
STRATEGY=wheel_strategy ACC_ID=12348 make config-account
STRATEGY=mixed_opportunistic ACC_ID=12349 make config-account

# Verify configuration
make config-validate
```

### Mixed Setup
Some strategies with specific accounts, others using indexes:

```bash
# High-touch strategies get dedicated accounts
STRATEGY=volatility_bet ACC_ID=12345 make config-account
STRATEGY=wheel_strategy ACC_ID=12346 make config-account

# Others use account indexes (accounts 0, 1, 2)
# No additional setup needed - uses default indexes
```

## üéõÔ∏è Parameter Customization

```bash
# More conservative barbell (lower delta)
STRATEGY=barbell_convex DELTA=0.25 make config-params

# More aggressive wheel (higher delta)

```

### Update Risk Limits
